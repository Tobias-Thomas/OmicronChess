# Omicron Chess  
This is a try to reimplement the paper "DeepChess: End-to-End Deep Neural Network for Autmatic Learning in Chess"  
Their idea is to first build an auto-encoder to convert a position to a vector and afterwards use positions from Computer Games to train a network to compare positions in a supervised training scenario.  
For playing games afterwards they used a tweaked version of the Alpha-Beta Search Algorithm
